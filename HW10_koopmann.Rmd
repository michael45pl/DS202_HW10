## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r accidents}
library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2)
accidents = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumouqiu/DS202-Spring2022/main/Practice/data/fars2016/accident.csv")
people = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumouqiu/DS202-Spring2022/main/Practice/data/fars2016/person.csv")
```

## Part 1

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
days <- accidents %>%
  group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% 
  mutate(Count = n())

ggplot(days, aes(x = DAY_WEEK)) + geom_bar(stat="Count") 
```
Accidents seem to be higher the closer you are to the weekends.  Specifically Day 1, 6 and 7.

```{r}
hours <- accidents %>%
  group_by(HOUR) %>% 
  mutate(Count = n())

ggplot(hours, aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_bar(stat="Count") + xlim(0,24)
```
Accidents are most likely to happen during the late afternoon.  Specifically hours between 15-23 which would be 3pm to 11pm.

```{r}
drunks <- accidents %>%
  count(DRUNK_DR >0) 
print(drunks)
```
There are 8720 accidents with at least one drunk driver

## Part 2

```{r}
drivers <- people %>%
  filter(PER_TYP==1)

combine <- merge(x = accidents, y = drivers, by=c("STATE","ST_CASE", "VE_FORMS", "COUNTY", "DAY", "MONTH", "HOUR", "MINUTE", "RUR_URB", "FUNC_SYS", "HARM_EV", "MAN_COLL", "SCH_BUS"), all = TRUE)

temp <- combine %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK, HOUR, SEX) %>% tally()

```

```{r}
ggplot(temp, aes(x=HOUR, y=n, fill = SEX)) + geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') + xlim(0,24) + labs(title = "Accidents by HOUR, SEX, and DAY", y = "Count") + facet_wrap(~DAY_WEEK)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
